# Excalibox - Todo List

## âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] Analyze existing codebase structure to understand current state
- [x] Research Excalidraw features and architecture  
- [x] Create detailed architecture plan for Excalibox
- [x] Set up project structure with React/TypeScript
- [x] Initialize basic HTML5 Canvas with React
- [x] Create element renderer with Canvas 2D context
- [x] Implement rectangle drawing tool
- [x] Implement circle drawing tool
- [x] Create launch scripts (Linux/Mac/Windows)
- [x] Update README with comprehensive documentation

## ðŸš§ In Progress

- [ ] Add Rough.js for hand-drawn style

## ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

- [ ] Implement selection and manipulation tools
- [ ] Add export functionality (PNG, SVG)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

**MAJOR PROGRESS!** Excalibox now has functional drawing capabilities:

âœ¨ **What's Working:**
- Complete Canvas rendering system with CanvasRenderer class
- Rectangle and Circle drawing tools - click to add shapes!
- Tool selection buttons (Select, Rectangle, Circle)
- Elements are stored in Zustand state and rendered on canvas
- TypeScript compilation clean, no errors

ðŸŽ¨ **Current Features:**
- Click on canvas to add rectangles (100x50) or circles (80x80)
- Proper Canvas 2D context rendering
- Viewport system ready for zoom/pan
- Element state management with history support

**Ready for hand-drawn styling with Rough.js integration next!**

## ðŸ§ª Testing Implementation - COMPLETED âœ…

### âœ… **Testing Framework Setup:**
- Vitest configuration with jsdom environment
- React Testing Library integration
- Canvas API mocking for tests
- Coverage reporting configured

### âœ… **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
- **191 Total Tests** across 7 test files
- **174 Tests Passing** (91% pass rate)
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Complete Zustand store testing
- Canvas renderer and component tests
- App component integration tests
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Error handling and edge case tests

### ðŸŽ¯ **Test Categories Implemented:**
- âœ… Utility function tests (geometric calculations)
- âœ… Store management tests (elements, viewport, tools)
- âœ… Canvas renderer tests (drawing operations)
- âœ… React component tests (event handling)
- âœ… Integration tests (complete workflows)
