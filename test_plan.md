# Test Plan - Excalibox Drawing Application
*Last Updated: 2025-01-28*

## Overview
This test plan describes what functionality is tested in the Excalibox application to ensure quality and reliability. All tests focus on user behavior, feature functionality, and application reliability rather than technical implementation details.

## Test Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è TEST INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ATTENTION (656/907 tests passing - 72.4%)

### üîß Current Test Issues:
1. **Test Infrastructure**: Fixed font loading issues in test environment
2. **Act() Warnings**: React state update warnings in integration tests
3. **Outdated Tests**: Some tests need updates for recent feature implementations
4. **Coverage Gaps**: 250 failing tests indicate areas needing maintenance

### ‚úÖ Recent Fixes:
- **Font Loading**: Resolved font manifest loading errors in test environment
- **Multi-Selection**: New comprehensive tests for group operations
- **Grid Snapping**: Enhanced test coverage for resizing with grid

**Note**: Core functionality works well, but test suite needs maintenance and updates.
